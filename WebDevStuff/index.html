    <p> This is a paragraph of text </p>

    <!-- This is a span or a child -->
    <em> This is italic </em>

    <span> This is a P tag THAT IS A SPAN </span>

    <p> This pragraph contains <em> spicy text</em></p>

    Semantic - Makes sense for readability? 
    Italic - Emphasised
    Bold - Strong

    Divs aren't very semantic:
    - nav
    - article   
    - side 
    - section
    - footer
